This is a test, I hope it goes well but worst case scenario I learn something
that wouldn't be so bad. It sure would be nice if it worked though. Is that
so much to hope for? Maybe. I guess wanting databases to be easy to write
is a bit foolish. It would be nice if it would just work though. That would
make me very happy.
