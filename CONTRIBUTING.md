I'm just having some fun hacking on this using cool data structures to 
make a cool picture in mind my a reality. My code style is a variant on
Allman because I felt like it, and my class structure is what it is 
because it made sense to me when I wrote it that way. If you feel like
contributing that's super cool! You don't have to do any of that. Please
do what I did and write code just exactly the way you want.
