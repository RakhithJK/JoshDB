I thought I'd take a crack at writing a database. Not like a SQL database, more like Datomic meets LevelDB. 
I have no intention of setting deadlines or deciding exactly what features it must include. I'm just kinda
hacking on it and seeing if I can make something cool. I've mostly been coding for work for the past
several years, and while that makes me money it isn't super satisfying existentially.
